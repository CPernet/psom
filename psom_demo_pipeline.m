% SUMMARY OF NIAK_DEMO_PIPELINE
%
% This is a script to demonstrate how to use the pipeline system for Octave
% and Matlab (PSOM)
%
% SYNTAX:
% Just type in PSOM_DEMO_PIPELINE
%
% This is a script and it will clear the workspace !!
% It will also create some files and one folder in ~/psom/data_demo/

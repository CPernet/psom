% SUMMARY OF PSOM_RUN_PIPELINE
%
% Run a pipeline using the Pipeline System for Octave and Matlab (PSOM).
%
% SYNTAX:
% [] = PSOM_RUN_PIPELINE(PIPELINE,OPT)
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% INPUTS:
%
% * PIPELINE
%       (structure) a matlab structure which defines a pipeline.
%       Each field name <JOB_NAME> will be used to name jobs in PMP and set
%       dependencies. The fields <JOB_NAME> are themselves structure, with
%       the following fields :
%
%       COMMAND
%           (string) the name of the command applied for this job.
%           This command can use the variables FILES_IN, FILES_OUT and OPT
%           associated with the job (see below).
%           Examples :
%               'niak_brick_something(files_in,files_out,opt);'
%               'my_function(opt)'
%
%       FILES_IN
%           (string, cell of strings, structure whose terminal nodes are
%           string or cell of strings)
%           The argument FILES_IN of the BRICK. Note that for properly
%           handling dependencies, this field needs to contain the exact
%           name of the file (full path, no wildcards, no '' for default
%           values).
%
%       FILES_OUT
%           (string, cell of strings, structure whose terminal nodes are
%           string or cell of strings) the argument FILES_OUT of
%           the BRICK. Note that for properly handling dependencies, this
%           field needs to contain the exact name of the file
%           (full path, no wildcards, no '' for default values).
%
%       OPT
%           (any matlab variable) options of the job. This field has no
%           impact on dependencies. OPT can for example be a structure,
%           where each field will be used as an argument of the command.
%
% OPT
%       (structure) with the following fields :
%
%       PATH_LOGS
%           (string) The folder where the .M and .MAT files will be stored.
%
%       NAME_PIPELINE
%           (string, default 'PSOM_pipeline') the name of the pipeline.
%           No space, no weird characters please.
%
%       MODE
%           (string, default 'session') how to execute the jobs :
%
%           'session'
%               the pipeline is executed within the current session. The
%               current matlab search path will be used instead of the one
%               that was active when the pipeline was initialized.
%
%           'batch'
%               Start the pipeline manager and each job in independent
%               matlab sessions. Note that more than one session can be
%               started at the same time to take advantage of
%               muli-processors machine. Moreover, the pipeline will run in
%               the background, you can continue to work, close matlab or
%               even unlog from your machine on a linux system without
%               interrupting it. The matlab path will be the same as the
%               one that was active when the pipeline was initialized. Log
%               files will be created for all jobs.
%
%           'qsub'
%               Use the qsub system (sge or pbs) to process the jobs. The
%               pipeline runs in the background.
%
%       FLAG_BATCH
%           (boolean, default 0) how to execute the pipeline :
%
%           If FLAG_BATCH == 0, the pipeline is executed within the session.
%               Interrupting the pipeline with CTRL-C will result in
%               interrupting the pipeline (you can always do a 'restart'
%               latter). 
%
%           If FLAG_BATCH == 1, the pipeline manager is started as a
%               separate process in its own Matlab or Octave session using
%               the 'at' system command. The pipeline will thus run in the
%               background and you can continue to work, close matlab or
%               even unlog from your machine on a linux system without
%               interrupting it. 
%
%       MAX_QUEUED
%           (integer, default 1 'batch' modes, Inf in 'session' and 'qsub'
%           modes)
%           The maximum number of jobs that can be processed
%           simultaneously. Some qsub systems actually put restrictions
%           on that. Contact your local system administrator for more info.
%
%       SHELL_OPTIONS
%           (string, default GB_PSOM_SHELL_OPTIONS defined in PSOM_GB_VARS)
%           some commands that will be added at the begining of the shell
%           script submitted to batch or qsub. This can be used to set 
%           important variables, or source an initialization script.
%
%       QSUB_OPTIONS
%           (string, GB_PSOM_QSUB_OPTIONS defined in PSOM_GB_VARS)
%           This field can be used to pass any argument when submitting a
%           job with qsub. For example, '-q all.q@yeatman,all.q@zeus' will
%           force qsub to only use the yeatman and zeus workstations in the
%           all.q queue. It can also be used to put restrictions on the
%           minimum avalaible memory, etc.
%
%       FLAG_RESTART
%           (boolean, default 0)
%           If FLAG_RESTART == 1, the processing of the pipeline will be
%           restarted even if a 'running' tag is found on the pipeline.
%           That is usefull to force a restart after a crash. In the
%           default behavior (FLAG_RESTART == 0), the pipeline will not be 
%           restarted, but the pipeline log will still be displayed if 
%           FLAG_BATCH == 1.
%
%       There are other minor options available, see PSOM_PIPELINE_INIT and
%       PSOM_PIPELINE_PROCESS.

% COMMENTS:
%
% Empty file strings or strings equal to 'gb_niak_omitted' in the pipeline 
% description are ignored in the dependency graph and checks for 
% the existence of required files.
%
% Existing 'running' or 'failed' tags will be removed. Make sure the
% pipeline is not already running if the background if you do that. That
% behavior is useful to restart a pipeline that has somehow crashed.

% SUMMARY PSOM_PIPELINE_INIT
%
% Convert a matlab-based pipeline structure into a set of mat files
% describing each job separatly.
%
% SYNTAX:
% FILE_PIPELINE = PSOM_PIPELINE_INIT(PIPELINE,OPT)
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% INPUTS:
%
% * PIPELINE
%       (structure) a matlab structure which defines a pipeline.
%       Each field name <JOB_NAME> will be used to name jobs in PMP and set
%       dependencies. The fields <JOB_NAME> are themselves structure, with
%       the following fields :
%
%       COMMAND
%           (string) the name of the command applied for this job.
%           This command can use the variables FILES_IN, FILES_OUT and OPT
%           associated with the job (see below).
%           Examples :
%               'niak_brick_something(files_in,files_out,opt);'
%               'my_function(opt)'
%
%       FILES_IN
%           (string, cell of strings, structure whose terminal nodes are
%           string or cell of strings)
%           The argument FILES_IN of the BRICK. Note that for properly
%           handling dependencies, this field needs to contain the exact
%           name of the file (full path, no wildcards, no '' for default
%           values).
%
%       FILES_OUT
%           (string, cell of strings, structure whose terminal nodes are
%           string or cell of strings) the argument FILES_OUT of
%           the BRICK. Note that for properly handling dependencies, this
%           field needs to contain the exact name of the file
%           (full path, no wildcards, no '' for default values).
%
%       OPT
%           (any matlab variable) options of the job. This field has no
%           impact on dependencies. OPT can for example be a structure,
%           where each field will be used as an argument of the command.
%
% * OPT
%       (structure) with the following fields :
%
%       PATH_LOGS
%           (string) The folder where the .M and .MAT files will be stored.
%
%       NAME_PIPELINE
%           (string, default 'PSOM_pipeline') the name of the pipeline.
%           No space, no weird characters please.
%
%       COMMAND_MATLAB
%           (string, default GB_NIAK_COMMAND_MATLAB or
%           GB_NIAK_COMMAND_OCTAVE depending on the current environment)
%           how to invoke matlab (or OCTAVE).
%           You may want to update that to add the full path of the command.
%           The defaut for this field can be set using the variable
%           GB_NIAK_COMMAND_MATLAB/OCTAVE in the file NIAK_GB_VARS.
%
%       FLAG_VERBOSE
%           (boolean, default 1) if the flag is 1, then the function prints
%           some infos during the processing.
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% OUTPUTS:
%
% FILE_PIPELINE
%       (string) the file name of the .MAT file recapitulating all the
%       infos on the pipeline
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% SEE ALSO:
%
% PSOM_PIPELINE_MANAGE, PSOM_PIPELINE_VISU, PSOM_DEMO_PIPELINE
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% COMMENTS:
%
% NOTE 1:
%
%   All directories for output files are created by PSOM_INIT_PIPELINE.
%
%   The directory PATH_LOGS is created. It contains the following files :
%
%   PATH_LOGS/NAME_PIPELINE.MAT
%       A .MAT file with the following variables:
%
%       PIPELINE, OPT
%           The inputs of the initialization
%
%       HISTORY
%           A string recapituling when and who created the pipeline, (and
%           on which machine).
%
%       DEPS, LIST_JOBS, FILES_IN, FILES_OUT, GRAPH_DEPS
%           See PSOM_BUILD_DEPENDENCIES for more info.
%
%   PATH_LOGS/NAME_PIPELINE.path_def.mat
%       The matlab search path for the pipeline (it is using the current
%       path, so make sure all the tools you need are available before
%       initializing the pipeline).
%
%   PATH_LOGS/<JOB_NAME>.M : A matlab or octave .M file which runs the
%       associated job.
%
%   PATH_LOGS/<JOB_NAME>.MAT : this file contains the variables FILES_IN,
%       FILES_OUT and OPT of the current stage.
%
%
% NOTE 2:
%
%   If a pipeline file already exists, the initialization will simply be
%   cancelled. You need to clean manually the logs before restarting a
%   pipeline.
%
%   There are plans to have an "update" mode in the future.
%
% NOTE 3:
%
%   There will be some checks done on the pipeline before initializing it :
%
%   1. That the dependency graph of the pipeline is a directed acyclic
%   graph, i.e. if job A depends on job B, job B does not depend (even
%   indirectly) on job A.
%
%   2. That an output file is not created twice. Overwritting on files is
%   regarded as a bug in a pipeline (forgetting to edit a copy-paste is a
%   common mistake).
